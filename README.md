# gettingandcleaningdataproject

In this project, I left very careful notes in the R script for what I did. All the relevant files are available in the repository.

I created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (various steps included in my script with notes along the way).
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
